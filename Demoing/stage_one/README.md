# TraffickingGrab


A tool used to scrape popular websites for instances of human trafficking.  Presently looks for sex trafficking.  This version is significantly faster than the older version, however it may not be suitable for some websites so I am storing it in a different repo.

#Disclaimer:

The data in this project has explicit material.  This is because I am an anti-slavery researcher interested in erraticating the problem of slavery.  An unfortunate part of slavery is that it involves many different sub-markets including but not limited to sex trafficking and child sex trafficking.

This means the data I am trying to process is sometimes pictures of prostitutes since these are the people I am trying to help - specifically if they are being forced into prostitution against their will.

I have made a best effort to only process images of people over the age of 18.
